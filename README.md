### Summary üìù

Neural Fitted Q-Iteration used a deep neural network for a Q-network, with its input being observation (s) and action (a) and its output being its action value (Q(s, a)). Instead of online Q-learning, the paper proposes **batch offline updates** by collecting experience throughout the episode and updating with that batch. The paper also suggests **hint-to-goal** method, where the neural network is trained explicitly in goal regions so that it can correctly estimate the value of the goal region.

### Installation üß±

This repository has [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) for easy installation of PyPI packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
