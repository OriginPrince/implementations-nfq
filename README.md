This repository is a implementation of the paper [Neural Fitted Q Iteration - First Experiences with a Data Efficient Neural Reinforcement Learning Method](/paper.pdf).

### Summary üìù

Neural Fitted Q-Iteration used a deep neural network for a Q-network, with its input being observation (s) and action (a) and its output being its action value (Q(s, a)). Instead of online Q-learning, the paper proposes **batch offline updates** by collecting experience throughout the episode and updating with that batch. The paper also suggests **hint-to-goal** method, where the neural network is trained explicitly in goal regions so that it can correctly estimate the value of the goal region.

### Results üìä

This repository uses **TensorBoard** for offline logging and **Weights & Biases** for online logging. You can see the all the metrics in [my summary report at Weights & Biases](https://app.wandb.ai/seungjaeryanlee/implementations-nfq/reports?view=seungjaeryanlee%2FSummary)!
